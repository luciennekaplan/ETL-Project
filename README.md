We took UFO and Meteorite Landing data and put it into a SQL Database!

## Extracting the Data
Through the use of kaggle.com we were able to find two CSV files which peaked our interest: one for UFO sightings from the National UFO Reporting Center, and another for Meteorite landings from the US Meteoritical Society. These each contained the location, date, and description of the objects. The UFO data also contained comments about the sighting, which was thoroughly entertaining to read through.
